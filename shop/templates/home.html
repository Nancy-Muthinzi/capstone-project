                <p>The Jewel Shop is more than just a shop. We are a gateway to empowerment. We believe that charitable
                    efforts, while noble, do not provide a long-term solution to poverty. Instead, economic development
                    and
                    job growth are the key to eliminating poverty for good. Our mission is to create steady, fair-waged
                    jobs
                    for our partner artisans in Kenya. Every product directly impacts the community and family of the
                    artisans who made
                    it.</p>
